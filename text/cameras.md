North Carolina Highway 12 (NC12) is the gateway to the Outer Banks, a chain of low-lying barrier islands. This roadway can flood both during storms and high tides. Access to NC12 is so important, it has its own Twitter: [@NCDOT_NC12](https://twitter.com/NCDOT_NC12). 

Here, we use public webcam imagery of NC12 from [DriveNC.gov](https://drivenc.gov) to train a machine learning model -- 
the NC12 FloodCamML -- to identify street flooding in real-time. We have
trained the model using 1,200 images, **but you can help make it smarter**. 

Help us train the NC12 FloodCamML!
